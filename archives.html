            <p><b>BABE (Expansion Pack)</b> is an unwieldy site-specific postmodern duet that began as
            a series of solos at bus stops throughout DC, and was in various stages of
            development and performance for eight months before premiering at Torpedo
            Factory Art Center in February, 2017. The work is the result of extensive
            collaboration between a total of four women, and is highly adaptable to both the
            environment in which it is being performed and the whims of the performers’
            emotions in the moment of performance. At its core, BABE is a stark and intimate
            examination of the process of creative women creating together. Questions of
            control, power and relationships were key elements in both the development and
            performance of this work. Each section developed organically from private
            conversations in the studio and prompted improvisations related to those
            exchanges. The performers were encouraged to respond to given structures with
            their authentic physicality, and to embrace the many assumed nuances of the classic
            duet relationship while developing the piece. The development of BABE was
            supported in part by AKIMBO Baltimore, Light Switch Dance Theatre and Torpedo
            Factory Art Center, and individual donors.</p>

            <p><b>CRADLE</b> is a work for four women that premiered at Dance Place (Washington, DC)
            in September 2015. At the core of CRADLE’s process was a shared desire to exercise
            demons – those primarily relating to navigating life in an urban environment as a
            woman. CRADLE embraced the multitudinous nature of women and of us
            specifically, embracing the tension of our relationship as collaborators, the silliness
            of our friendship, and the brutal realization of how much women need each other to
            navigate life. The Washington Post declared CRADLE “tonally bizarre,” and we
            agreed – after all, isn’t that an apt description of everyday life as a woman? CRADLE
            was supported in part by Dance Metro DC’s Choreographers’ Commission Grant, The
            George Washington University and individual donors.</p>

            Festival in 2013. UGLY THINGS explores the scary shoulda-coulda-woulda thoughts
            of a daydreaming nine-to-fiver. The work consisted of four sections, each of which
            has been performed on its own in various iterations since the original work
            premiered. These mini works include: At Bay, Nice Jewish Girls and Bush League.
            UGLY THINGS was restaged and further developed in late 2013 as UGLY THINGS:
            Againandagainandagain for the Greenberg Theatre stage.</p>
