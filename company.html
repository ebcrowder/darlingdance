        <p><b>Hayley Cutler (artistic director)</b> is a choreographer, dance educator and experimental performer living in Washington, DC. She received her MFA and BA in Dance from The George Washington University and a postgraduate diploma from the Laban Conservatoire of Dance. Since founding darlingdance in 2010, life has been a wonderful ride of movement making, postmodern booty-shaking and collaborative earth-quaking. Her work has been presented in London, Chicago, Boston and throughout her beloved DC at Dance Place, Dance Exchange, The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, Atlas Performing Arts Center, The Jack Guidone Theater, Torpedo Factory Art Center, her tiny apartment, bus stops, street corners and beyond. Hayley is a freelance dance educator teaching movement freedom and improvisation to populations ranging from young mothers to adults with physical and intellectual disabilities to university dance majors. In dance and life, Hayley is most interested in the moment when improvisation becomes composition, awakening an honest aesthetic and giving way for all bodies to move. In her work, she is most curious about the shared and varied histories of women at home in their bodies. The Washington Post once declared Hayley's work "tonally bizarre." She tonally agrees.
